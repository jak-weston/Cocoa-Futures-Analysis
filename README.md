# Cocoa Futures Analysis

## Project Overview
An advanced data analysis project that investigates the relationship between agroclimatological factors (particularly El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation) and cocoa futures market volatility. The project combines NASA POWER DAV Tool data with financial market data to predict cocoa price movements.

## Key Features
- **Climate-Market Correlation Analysis**: Examines how weather patterns affect cocoa futures prices
- **NASA POWER DAV Integration**: Utilizes satellite-derived agroclimatological data
- **Price Spread Analysis**: Studies COCO Wisdom Tree and CCc1 spread dynamics
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Plotly-based charts for market trend analysis
- **Multi-Source Data Integration**: Combines climate, market, and agricultural data

## Data Sources
- **NASA POWER DAV Tool**: Agroclimatological measurements
  - Temperature metrics (T2M, T2M_MAX, T2M_MIN)
  - Soil conditions (TS, GWETPROF)
  - Precipitation data (PRECTOTCORR)
- **Market Data**
  - Daily cocoa futures prices
  - Trading volumes
  - Price spreads
- **Agricultural Data**
  - Cocoa production forecasts
  - Supply chain metrics

## Analysis Components
