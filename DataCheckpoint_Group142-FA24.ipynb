    "Cocoa grows in the pods of the Theobroma cacao tree with a name that roughly translates to “God food” in Greek. Since the Aztecs and Mayans, Cocoa had long been used as a form of consumable currency.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](https://chocolateclass.wordpress.com/2020/03/24/cacao-currency-ancient-civilizations-used-chocolate-as-cash/#:~:text=Although%20people%20mostly%20bartered%20goods,Aztecs%2C%20valued%20cacao%20as%20money\n",
    ") This commodity has become a highly prized export in the modern world. We use Cocoa not only to make desserts and a large variety of drinks, but it is also used for a number of skin products such as lotions, creams, and lip balms which is why it is traded so abundantly.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](https://www.markets.com/education-centre/cocoa-trading/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cocoa futures are similar to stocks and bonds, in the sense that they allow traders to buy and sell cocoa at predetermined prices on a specified future date. When trading, a future contract represents 10 metric tons of cocoa thus can be sold either partially. Cocoa is traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in London. The South Asian market and London prices are based on cocoa produced in African regions, particularly Ghana and the Ivory Coast—two of the world’s largest sources of cocoa production. Cocoa is one of the smallest soft commodity markets, but regardless it still has a major influence on the futures market.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/cocoa#:~:text=12%20of%202024.-,Cocoa%20increased%203%2C560.48%20USD/MT%20or%2084.85%25%20since%20the%20beginning,9639.41%20in%2012%20months%20time.&text=Cocoa%20is%20traded%20on%20New,difference%20(CFD)%20financial%20instruments)\n",
    "\n",
    "The COCO Wisdom Tree and CCc1 spread are key indicators in the cocoa futures market. The COCO Wisdom Tree is an exchange-traded product that tracks cocoa futures prices, providing investors with a way to gain exposure to the cocoa market without directly trading futures. The CCc1 spread represents the difference between two different cocoa futures contracts, typically from different delivery months. This spread can widen or narrow based on market expectations of supply and demand, reflecting shifts caused by weather patterns, geopolitical factors, or speculative trading. By analyzing these spreads, traders gain insights into short-term price volatility and market sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cocoa futures provide crucial financial instruments for both producers and buyers. Farmers use futures contracts to hedge against potential price drops, securing stable income despite volatile market conditions. Similarly, manufacturers such as Hershey and Mondelez use futures contracts to protect against rising cocoa costs, ensuring they can stabilize their production costs. High volatility in cocoa futures, driven by agroclimatic events like ENSO, forces these actors to adjust their strategies accordingly, sometimes leading to sudden changes in pricing for consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last year, the highest recorded price of cocoa futures was \\\\$12,261.2 (April 19th 2024) per metric ton which was about a 76 percent increase from (April 19th 2023) at \\\\$2,979.00. This was due to a low crop yield in the Ivory coast and Ghana in 2023 due to low rainfall, plant disease and the short lifespan of the cacao tree. Since the Ivory coast accounts for more than 60% of the world's cocoa production, thus the shortage was met with a wave of financial speculation leading not only the future prices of coca to spike, but also big name brands such as Hershey and Mondelez, the company that produces Cadbury and Toblorne to increase their prices about 5 and 6 percent respectively.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](https://chocolateclass.wordpress.com/2020/03/24/cacao-currency-ancient-civilizations-used-chocolate-as-cash/#:~:text=Although%20people%20mostly%20bartered%20goods,Aztecs%2C%20valued%20cacao%20as%20money)\n",
    "\n",
    "Agroclimatological factors like temperature, water availability, soil fertility, and humidity are critical to the health and productivity of cocoa trees. Extreme deviations from the optimal growing conditions—such as those brought on by ENSO—can exacerbate supply disruptions, leading to significant fluctuations in the futures market. Investors and traders monitor these environmental indicators closely, as a poor growing season can prompt speculative trading, increasing market volatility. Conversely, favorable weather conditions can lead to market corrections and oversupply, which may depress prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the weather-related factors, another significant change in the cocoa market has been the increasing conversion of cocoa plantations to palm oil production in some regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. Palm oil is often seen as a more profitable crop due to its high demand and versatile uses, leading many farmers to switch away from cocoa. This shift has contributed to the recent reduction in cocoa supply, further driving up prices in an already volatile market. Combined with weather disruptions like El Niño, these supply-side constraints have amplified market volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study will use historical data from March 1st 2024 to October 15th 2024, focusing on major ENSO events and their corresponding impacts on cocoa production, futures prices, and market volatility. By incorporating data from the Regional NASA POWER DAV Tool, we aim to quantify how accurately these agroclimatic features can predict daily fluctuations in the COCO Wisdom Tree and CCc1 spread.\n"

    "The data from the Regional NASA POWER DAV Tool is likely to be free from direct privacy concerns since it deals with weather patterns and agroclimatological features rather than personal information. However, one potential ethical issue could arise from market biases. For instance, cocoa futures markets may disproportionately affect certain regions like West Africa, where cocoa farming is a crucial livelihood. Over-reliance on market speculation driven by environmental data could indirectly harm smallholder farmers, especially if it triggers significant price volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, biases in the dataset might arise from incomplete or skewed data collection. For example, if the ENSO data disproportionately focuses on certain regions, or if some climatic factors are weighted more heavily than others, the analysis may produce results that don’t fully account for all relevant variables. To address this, we will carefully evaluate data completeness and strive to ensure an equitable representation of climatic impacts across cocoa-producing regions. We will also include measures to detect biases by comparing different regional trends and assessing whether certain groups are disproportionately affected by market volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we must be cautious about how we communicate our findings, especially in a manner that could unduly influence financial markets. Ensuring that our analysis does not overstate predictive certainty is essential to avoid exacerbating speculative behaviors that could harm producers in vulnerable regions. Transparency about the limitations of our data and models will be a key component of handling these ethical concerns."
