    "\n",
    "We looked at the causes and relationships between various agroclimatological factors and volatility in cocoa futures prices, focusing on the specific metrics of the COCO Wisdom Tree and CCc1 spread. Observing the high volatility of cocoa futures prices, we aimed to investigate the role of environmental factors in driving these fluctuations. Our goal was to identify patterns and ways to aid stakeholders across the cocoa supply chain in understanding and predicting future volatility.\n",
    "Our analysis involved gathering agroclimatological data from the NASA POWER DAV tool, combined with past cocoa futures data. We divided the climate data into geographic regions (stations) to pinpoint localized weather patterns and concurrently divided the cocoa futures into separate time periods to observe how prices changed over time. We conducted a series of analysis in order to identify these trends and later presented our findings in a clear and intuitive way.\n",
    "Our findings were able to show a strong positive correlation between temperature and cocoa prices which tells us that higher temperatures may lead to an increase in price volatility. Similarly, we were also able to observe a strong negative correlation between soil moisture and market prices; poor growing conditions were linked to higher prices due to supply constraints. Moreover, we concluded that early contracts are more sensitive to climatic variations, while later contracts show market stabilization as long-term supply expectations are priced in. Overall, we concluded that temperature and soil moisture are critical predictors of cocoa market volatility."

We intend to expand this analysis by including a wider range of cocoa futures contracts and market indices to assess the generalizability of the results. However, due to losing access to the Refinitive token, we are currently unable to include additional market indices and futures contracts.

    "Cocoa grows in the pods of the Theobroma cacao tree with a name that roughly translates to “God food” in Greek. Since the Aztecs and Mayans, Cocoa had long been used as a form of consumable currency.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](https://chocolateclass.wordpress.com/2020/03/24/cacao-currency-ancient-civilizations-used-chocolate-as-cash/#:~:text=Although%20people%20mostly%20bartered%20goods,Aztecs%2C%20valued%20cacao%20as%20money\n",
    ") This commodity has become a highly prized export in the modern world. We use Cocoa not only to make desserts and a large variety of drinks, but it is also used for a number of skin products such as lotions, creams, and lip balms which is why it is traded so abundantly.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](https://www.markets.com/education-centre/cocoa-trading/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cocoa futures are similar to stocks and bonds, in the sense that they allow traders to buy and sell cocoa at predetermined prices on a specified future date. When trading, a future contract represents 10 metric tons of cocoa thus can be sold either partially. Cocoa is traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in London. The South Asian market and London prices are based on cocoa produced in African regions, particularly Ghana and the Ivory Coast—two of the world’s largest sources of cocoa production. Cocoa is one of the smallest soft commodity markets, but regardless it still has a major influence on the futures market.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/cocoa#:~:text=12%20of%202024.-,Cocoa%20increased%203%2C560.48%20USD/MT%20or%2084.85%25%20since%20the%20beginning,9639.41%20in%2012%20months%20time.&text=Cocoa%20is%20traded%20on%20New,difference%20(CFD)%20financial%20instruments)\n",
    "\n",
    "The COCO Wisdom Tree and CCc1 spread are key indicators in the cocoa futures market. The COCO Wisdom Tree is an exchange-traded product that tracks cocoa futures prices, providing investors with a way to gain exposure to the cocoa market without directly trading futures. The CCc1 spread represents the difference between two different cocoa futures contracts, typically from different delivery months. This spread can widen or narrow based on market expectations of supply and demand, reflecting shifts caused by weather patterns, geopolitical factors, or speculative trading. By analyzing these spreads, traders gain insights into short-term price volatility and market sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cocoa futures provide crucial financial instruments for both producers and buyers. Farmers use futures contracts to hedge against potential price drops, securing stable income despite volatile market conditions. Similarly, manufacturers such as Hershey and Mondelez use futures contracts to protect against rising cocoa costs, ensuring they can stabilize their production costs. High volatility in cocoa futures, driven by agroclimatic events like ENSO, forces these actors to adjust their strategies accordingly, sometimes leading to sudden changes in pricing for consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last year, the highest recorded price of cocoa futures was \\\\$12,261.2 (April 19th 2024) per metric ton which was about a 76 percent increase from (April 19th 2023) at \\\\$2,979.00. This was due to a low crop yield in the Ivory coast and Ghana in 2023 due to low rainfall, plant disease and the short lifespan of the cacao tree. Since the Ivory coast accounts for more than 60% of the world's cocoa production, thus the shortage was met with a wave of financial speculation leading not only the future prices of coca to spike, but also big name brands such as Hershey and Mondelez, the company that produces Cadbury and Toblorne to increase their prices about 5 and 6 percent respectively.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](https://chocolateclass.wordpress.com/2020/03/24/cacao-currency-ancient-civilizations-used-chocolate-as-cash/#:~:text=Although%20people%20mostly%20bartered%20goods,Aztecs%2C%20valued%20cacao%20as%20money)\n",
    "\n",
    "Agroclimatological factors like temperature, water availability, soil fertility, and humidity are critical to the health and productivity of cocoa trees. Extreme deviations from the optimal growing conditions—such as those brought on by ENSO—can exacerbate supply disruptions, leading to significant fluctuations in the futures market. Investors and traders monitor these environmental indicators closely, as a poor growing season can prompt speculative trading, increasing market volatility. Conversely, favorable weather conditions can lead to market corrections and oversupply, which may depress prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the weather-related factors, another significant change in the cocoa market has been the increasing conversion of cocoa plantations to palm oil production in some regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. Palm oil is often seen as a more profitable crop due to its high demand and versatile uses, leading many farmers to switch away from cocoa. This shift has contributed to the recent reduction in cocoa supply, further driving up prices in an already volatile market. Combined with weather disruptions like El Niño, these supply-side constraints have amplified market volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study will use historical data from March 1st 2024 to October 15th 2024, focusing on major ENSO events and their corresponding impacts on cocoa production, futures prices, and market volatility. By incorporating data from the Regional NASA POWER DAV Tool, we aim to quantify how accurately these agroclimatic features can predict daily fluctuations in the COCO Wisdom Tree and CCc1 spread."

This fluctuation aligns with the natural cycle of moisture retention in the soil due to varying precipitation levels.\n",

    "The data from the Regional NASA POWER DAV Tool is likely to be free from direct privacy concerns since it deals with weather patterns and agroclimatological features rather than personal information. However, one potential ethical issue could arise from market biases. For instance, cocoa futures markets may disproportionately affect certain regions like West Africa, where cocoa farming is a crucial livelihood. Over-reliance on market speculation driven by environmental data could indirectly harm smallholder farmers, especially if it triggers significant price volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, biases in the dataset might arise from incomplete or skewed data collection. For example, if the ENSO data disproportionately focuses on certain regions, or if some climatic factors are weighted more heavily than others, the analysis may produce results that don’t fully account for all relevant variables. To address this, we will carefully evaluate data completeness and strive to ensure an equitable representation of climatic impacts across cocoa-producing regions. We will also include measures to detect biases by comparing different regional trends and assessing whether certain groups are disproportionately affected by market volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we must be cautious about how we communicate our findings, especially in a manner that could unduly influence financial markets. Ensuring that our analysis does not overstate predictive certainty is essential to avoid exacerbating speculative behaviors that could harm producers in vulnerable regions. Transparency about the limitations of our data and models will be a key component of handling these ethical concerns."

    "# Discusison and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Cocoa futures form the foundation of both, farming and manufacturing.This is seen in a number of entities involved in the production and production of cocoa. First of all, because cocoa futures protect farmers from price drops, which could negatively affect how they make a living, they provide income stability. If rising cocoa prices cause output to become unstable, manufacturers also bear the effects, as this can result in higher costs and unstable product pricing and distribution. We think that in order for all parties involved in the cocoa supply chain to make wise choices about production, pricing, and/or distribution, it is essential to be able to forecast this market volatility.\n",
    "The goal of this study was to find out how well certain agroclimatological features could forecast future volatility in cocoa futures and market prices. Two important metrics, the CCc1 spread and the COCO Wisdom Tree, were the focus of our investigation. These metrics are significant because they provide insight into the short term market volatility and the broader market structure of the cocoa industry. To properly examine this, we used historical data spanning seven months.\n",
    "\n",
    "We were able to identify significant relationships between agroclimatological factors and cocoa price volatility, just as we originally hypothesized. A strong positive correlation between temperature and cocoa prices was found that suggests elevated temperatures indicate stress on cocoa crops. This crop stress most commonly occurs during critical growing periods which leads to less crop yields. As a result, farmers can become worried about supply shortages, propelling market volatility and price increases. Poor soil moisture suggests unfavorable growing conditions, which can be associated with droughts or water scarcity, which can eventually lead to a decline in crop health and a shortage of supply, which leads to higher pricing. We also can see a clear difference in how market contracts respond to changes in weather patterns. We concluded that early contracts are more prone to agroclimatological changes; the market responds to immediate instabilities and fluctuations in crop production. In contrast, later contracts show signs of market stabilization. We think this is likely the result of long term supply expectations and/or additional economic or climatic patterns that were factored into the pricing over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bridging back to the importance of why we decided to focus on COCO Wisdom Tree and CCc1 spread, these were chosen as the focal market metrics. The COCO Wisdom Tree, being a traded product that tracks cocoa futures prices, particularly simplifies market behavior analyses and supplies us with a clearer understanding of the overall trends in the market. The CCc1 spread metric, which is the price difference between two cocoa futures contracts, explains the changes in supply and demand expectations over time. And so, the interplay of these two metrics helps us quantify and better understand the relationships between agroclimatological factors and how they influence market instabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining the climate data from the NASA POWER DAV tool and the cocoa futures data was a strategic move on our part because it allowed us to link environmental data patterns to market fluctuations. Merging these datasets helped us establish a temporal relationship between climatic events and price changes. We achieved this by aligning both datasets by date to directly compare daily climate conditions with cocoa price trends. To do this, we divided the climate data into geographic/spatial regions called stations to identify localized weather patterns, and then we divided the futures data into time periods called separations to observe identifiable and recurring patterns. As a result, we produced a merged dataset that provided a holistic overview, connecting agroclimatological factors to both short and long term price spikes and market stabilization. We acknowledged the limitations of this approach, particularly the time frame, which leaves room for improvement since we chose a 7 month period. This duration does not capture the entire ENSO cycle or other significant events, which were initially of interest for this project but were difficult to analyze due to the data available. We lacked access to some other futures contracts, which could have provided a more comprehensive perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, we now understand the critical importance of agroclimatological factors in shaping market behavior, which is essential for building a resilient cocoa supply chain. Cocoa is known to be highly sensitive to various climatic, agricultural, and weather factors, making this analysis especially relevant in our present day. As climate change continues to escalate, it directly harms agricultural systems, creating disruptions that ripple through the global economy. By understanding these interactions and patterns, we can not only help stakeholders in the cocoa industry anticipate and mitigate risks but also contribute to future efforts toward sustainability and strategic planning.\n",
